Husk Ã¥ nevne hvor jeg har hentet teoridelen fra. Tidligere oppgaver, husk selvsitering. 

The first part of the thesis will focus on the theory. First, a gentle introduction to quantum mechanics is presented. The focus is on the parts that are relevant to the rest of the thesis. After that, machine learning will be discussed. The last part of the theory section will concentrate on Variational Monte Carlo Methods.

In the next part we will go into the details on how to efficiently implement the algorithms, and look at how it can be done in Julia.

The next part will present the results from running the simulations on system of particles, both interacting and non-interacting. The different methods are compared.
